<blockquote><p>Therapy helps you be your best self, whatever that looks like for you individually.

Therapy helps you discover meaning and adjust your understanding of you and your environment.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My experiences include working with teens and adults on a wide range of difficulties. Some of these difficulties include trauma, substance use, depression, anxiety, bipolar, grief, relationship difficulties, emotion regulation, stress, life transitions, and sexual identity.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Treatment is based on individual need to determine what works best for you. Interventions are designed to help you learn about yourself, understand how you interact with others, reduce distress, and discover and understand what is not currently working for you. This is a journey, which for many can be scary, allow me to guide you on this journey to discover your best self.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Education</strong></p>
